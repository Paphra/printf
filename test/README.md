#TESTS
- I have done some tests in this way

```
1. Copied all the files from our root folder and brought them to test folder
2. run the command to compile
	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
3. got the a.out executable and ran it
```
- The output I have received is like this

```
root@77d4f67c086c:~/printf/test# ./a.out
Let's try to printf a simple sentence.

I have removed the files but you can reproduce the same following the steps or another approach
