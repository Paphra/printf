# This is a customized printf function
This works like the normal printf, and handles the following type specifiers:
```
‘%c’: for single characters
‘%s’: for strings
‘%%’: for writing normal percent sign
‘%i’ : for printing and integer
‘%d’: also for printing an integer
```
## Example call
```
_printf("I am fine and %s!\n", "cool");
```
